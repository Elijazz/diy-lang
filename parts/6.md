## Part 6: working with lists

This is the last section before we're done implementing the language, and compared to the last part it should be relatively easy.

Any proper language needs good data structures, and *lists* are one of them. To be able to work properly with lists, weâ€™ll introduce four new forms to our language:

- `cons` is used to construct lists from a "head" element, and the rest of the list (the "tail").
- `head` extracts the first element of a list
- `tail` returns the rest of the elements, once the first is dropped.
- `empty` takes a list as input, and returns `#t` if it is empty and `#f` otherwise.

Go on then, finish your language.

```bash
nosetests tests/test_6_working_with_lists.py --stop
```

### What's next?

With the language implementation done, it's time to use our language in [part 7](7.md).
